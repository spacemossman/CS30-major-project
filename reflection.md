# Reflection 
## Advice to my past self

One of the major bumps I had was at the very start of the project. I completely forgot about the p5 library called collide, which makes up most of my project. I would simply tell past me that this library existed, and to implement it as soon as possible. Also, not to give up when something breaks. I struggled a lot with staying true to the task and not immediately giving up when the code is not working the way it should. It's all going to work out in the end. 

## Hardest part of the project

There were multiple difficulties in this project, with text breaking every other second, sound, and hit boxes not working properly. The hardest part though, was definitely sound. Sound was interesting because I wanted to have two different songs for background music when you switched between rooms. Also I added a toy that when clicked, played a small circus tune. I suffered for a while with the switches between the background music. I eventually decided to just stick with the one background music, because I couldn't figure out a way to solve it

## Did you complete the nice to have list? 

I did complete everything on the nice to have list, including adding a menu screen. Unfortunately, I had to edit my list halfway through the project, when I realised that adding characters was out of the question. For starters, I only had the player on screen, and would have had to add a second room, just to talk to an npc. I also had no idea how to start with dialogue (coding), and didn't have time to write a conversation. Not to mention, my primary goal was to have two npc's. 

## What are you most proud of? 

I am most proud of the inventory. I was waiting to do that last, because at first I was worried that it would be the most difficult thing of the project. But, It turned out to be one of the easiest. Especially with the combine and examine. It took me about two days to do inventory, which I am very proud of. Also, I managed to finish the project on time!
